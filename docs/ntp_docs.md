# NTP

NTP (Network Time Protocol) is a protocol used to synchronize the system time across multiple servers over a network. Accurate time synchronization is essential for coordination, security, and consistency in distributed systems and cloud infrastructures.

## Time Server

A time server is a system that responds to time synchronization requests from other devices over a network. When it uses the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to provide accurate time, it is called an NTP server.

## Why NTP Server?

Time synchronization plays a critical role in distributed systems, especially in large cloud infrastructures such as OpenStack. Below are key reasons why NTP servers are essential:

- **Token-based authentication**:

    In large cloud infrastructures like OpenStack, time synchronization is critical because authentication tokens are time-sensitive. If a server's system clock is not synchronized, it may reject valid tokens with errors such as "not yet valid" or "expired." NTP (Network Time Protocol) ensures consistent and accurate time across all nodes in the infrastructure, helping to prevent such authentication failures.

- **Logs consistency issues**:

    In large cloud infrastructures, services often run across multiple servers. Without proper time synchronization, each server may record log entries using slightly different timestamps. This makes it difficult to trace errors across multiple systems. By using NTP, all servers maintain a consistent system time, ensuring logs are aligned and easier to interpret during debugging or audits.

- **Scheduled jobs**:

    Certain tasks or jobs may need to run simultaneously across multiple servers. If server clocks are not synchronized, these actions may execute at inconsistent times, leading to failures, data corruption, or unexpected behavior. NTP ensures that all servers maintain a consistent system time, enabling coordinated and predictable task execution.

An NTP server is a fundamental component in any cloud or distributed infrastructure. It ensures reliable communication, secure authentication, synchronized logging, and proper task execution by keeping all systems aligned in time.
