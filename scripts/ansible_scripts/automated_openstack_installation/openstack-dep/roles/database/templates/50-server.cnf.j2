# MariaDB server configuration.
#
# The MariaDB server is configured right out of the box (pun intended) to be
# a drop-in replacement for MySQL.
#
# The main configuration file is /etc/mysql/my.cnf.
# It includes all files that are present in this /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/ directory.
#
# You can create your own configuration file in this directory, for example
# /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/my-custom.cnf to override the defaults.
#
# For more information, see the MariaDB Knowledgebase:
# https://mariadb.com/kb/en/configuring-mariadb-with-configuration-files/
