# Security Considerations for OpenStack Nova Deployment

## Overview
This document outlines critical security considerations for the OpenStack Nova deployment project. While this is designed for development/testing environments, production deployments require additional security hardening.

## Current Security Configuration

### Database Security
- **MariaDB Configuration**: Uses Unix socket authentication for root access
- **Database Users**: Dedicated OpenStack database user with limited privileges
- **Network Access**: Database allows connections from compute nodes (% wildcard)
- **⚠️ Production Concern**: Database passwords are stored in plain text in variable files

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Keystone Integration**: All services properly registered with Keystone
- **Service Users**: Dedicated service users for each OpenStack component
- **Role Assignments**: Proper admin role assignments in service project
- **Token Security**: Fernet tokens configured for Keystone

### Network Security
- **SSH Configuration**: Vagrant SSH keys with proper permissions (600)
- **Host Key Checking**: Disabled in ansible.cfg for development (⚠️ Security Risk)
- **Firewall**: Uses NoopFirewallDriver for simplicity (⚠️ Production Risk)
- **VNC Access**: Configured to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)

### System Security
- **AppArmor**: Disabled for compatibility (⚠️ Security Trade-off)
- **Swap**: Disabled to prevent memory dumps
- **User Permissions**: Proper service user configurations
- **File Permissions**: Restrictive permissions on configuration files (640)

## Production Security Recommendations

### 1. Credential Management
```bash
# Use Ansible Vault for sensitive data
ansible-vault encrypt inventory/group_vars/all.yml

# Or use external secret management
# - HashiCorp Vault
# - AWS Secrets Manager
# - Azure Key Vault
```

### 2. Network Security
```yaml
# Enable proper firewall in nova.conf
firewall_driver = nova.virt.firewall.IptablesFirewall
# Enable SSL/TLS for API endpoints
ssl_cert_file = /path/to/cert.pem
ssl_key_file = /path/to/key.pem
```

### 3. Database Security
```yaml
# Use SSL for database connections
database_connection: mysql+pymysql://user:pass@host/db?ssl_ca=/path/to/ca.pem

# Restrict database access by IP
# Replace % wildcard with specific IP addresses
```

### 4. System Hardening
```bash
# Enable AppArmor/SELinux
sudo systemctl enable apparmor
sudo systemctl start apparmor

# Configure proper firewall rules
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH
sudo ufw allow 5000/tcp  # Keystone
sudo ufw allow 8774/tcp  # Nova API
sudo ufw allow 8778/tcp  # Placement
sudo ufw allow 9292/tcp  # Glance
```

### 5. Monitoring & Auditing
```yaml
# Enable audit logging in nova.conf
[audit]
enabled = true
audit_map_file = /etc/nova/api_audit_map.conf
```

## Security Checklist for Production

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Encrypt all sensitive variables with Ansible Vault
- [ ] Review and harden all default passwords
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates for all API endpoints
- [ ] Set up proper firewall rules
- [ ] Enable host key checking in Ansible
- [ ] Configure proper backup and disaster recovery

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Change all default service passwords
- [ ] Enable audit logging for all services
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure log rotation and retention
- [ ] Perform security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Set up regular security updates

### Network Security
- [ ] Isolate management network from tenant networks
- [ ] Configure VPN access for administrative tasks
- [ ]
Use network segmentation and VLANs
- [ ] Implement intrusion detection systems
- [ ] Configure rate limiting for API endpoints

### Access Control
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication
- [ ] Set up role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Regular access reviews and cleanup
- [ ] Implement session timeout policies

## Known Security Limitations (Development Environment)

1. **Plain Text Passwords**: All service passwords stored in plain text
2. **Disabled Host Key Checking**: SSH connections don't verify host keys
3. **NoopFirewallDriver**: No network filtering between instances
4. **Disabled AppArmor**: Reduced system-level security
5. **Permissive Network Configuration**: Services listen on all interfaces
6. **No SSL/TLS**: All API communications in plain text
7. **Default Credentials**: Using predictable default passwords

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Response
1. Isolate affected systems immediately
2. Preserve logs and evidence
3. Notify security team and stakeholders
4. Begin forensic analysis
5. Implement containment measures
6. Plan recovery and remediation

### Log Monitoring
Monitor these critical events:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Unusual API access patterns
- Database access anomalies
- System configuration changes

## Compliance Considerations

For production deployments, consider compliance with:
- SOC 2 Type II
- ISO 27001
- PCI DSS (if handling payment data)
- GDPR (if handling EU personal data)
- HIPAA (if handling healthcare data)
